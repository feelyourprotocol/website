- **Improve documentation** — fix typos, add guides, clarify explanations
- **Report issues** — found a bug or have a suggestion? Open an issue

## Development Workflow

2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Run linting and tests:

```bash

npm run test:e2e    # E2E tests
```

5. Submit a pull request

## Code Style
